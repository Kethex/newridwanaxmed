Ridwan Axmed
=====================================
Masters in Physics at the University of Bristol. My research interests include computing, particle physics and 
the intersection of those two fields.

CV
=====================================
Education
-------------------------------------
**University of Bristol** - [2017 - 2021]

* MSci Physics: Predicted to obtain a first-class degree.

**Downend School** - [2010 - 2017]

* AAA in Mathematics, Biology, and Physics.

Work experience
--------------------------------------
Research Assistant, **Interface Analysis Centre**, *University of Bristol*. [*Present*]

* Working with the IAC in order to develop comprehensive and convenient methods for detecting radiation.

* Utilising languages such as Python in order to simulate and model radiation leakages.

Summer Physics Intern, **QLM Technology**, *Bristol, UK*. [*08/2019 - 09/2019*]

* Aided in the characterisation of single-photon avalanche detectors (implemented using CMOS) by altering properties such as temperature and voltage in order to find optimum operating parameters.

* Analysed large amounts of data using OriginLab, which was subsequently plotted and graphed.

* Worked on existing Python and Julia code in order to output images as a slow animation rather than stills, using libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib in order to achieve this. Exposure to both Arduino and MatLab code.

I have also worked as a part-time teaching assistant/tutor at Learning Brains, and as a member of CHAOS.

Notebooks
=======================================
I keep notebooks on topics that personally interest me; from philosophy of science, various sub-disciplines of physics,
and complexity. Full credit goes to Cosma Shalizi, this being a pale imitation of his.
